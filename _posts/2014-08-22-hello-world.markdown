Hello World!

I've often thought about starting a tech blog, but the effort has always stalled because I wasn't convinced I really had anything valuable to say. That may very well be true, but what I've realized is that it doesn't matter. This blog isn't targeted at the masses in the hopes that I'll gain fame and fortune. Rather, it's for my own growth, as I learn how to distill my thoughts and put them in writing. I've always found that writing something down helps my clarify my thoughts, and I'm hoping that this will be no different.

As for what I'll be writing about, I'm not quite sure yet. I have a few ideas around snippets of code that might be generally useful and some of the tools I use to write that code, but nothing concrete (yet).  I suppose only time will tell.
